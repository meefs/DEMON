# Realtime Motion-to-Music (Web)

Browser-based real-time motion-to-music demo. A Python backend runs the
GPU pipeline behind an HTTP + WebSocket server; a Next.js front-end
renders the live UI:

- Upload a source audio file, get a live ACE-Step stream back
- Live-editable prompt
- Every knob visible at once in stacked Core / Groups / Keystones
  sections (no bank tab switching)
- Optional hardware MIDI input via the Web MIDI API with per-knob
  **MIDI learn**: click `CC ?` next to any knob, wiggle a physical
  control, and it rebinds live. Mappings persist per option-profile in
  localStorage; click `Reset MIDI map` to restore the auto-map.
- Optional webcam motion input (frame-diff driving `denoise`)
- HUD canvas with waveform background, history trails, playhead, SDE
  curve, and live stats
- Zstd-compressed delta slices decoded in the browser

## Requirements

- **Server**: the full ACE-Step install (CUDA GPU, `uv sync`, prebuilt
  TensorRT engines). No extra dependencies beyond the main project.
- **Client**: any modern Chromium or Firefox. Web MIDI and webcam
  support are optional.

## Run

A single launcher starts the Python backend on `:1318` and a Next.js
dev server on `:6660` with combined output:

```bash
uv run python -u -m demos.realtime_motion_graph_web.run
# forward backend args after `--`:
uv run python -u -m demos.realtime_motion_graph_web.run -- --accel eager
```

First run installs `web/node_modules` automatically (Node.js 20+ required).
Open `http://localhost:6660`. Next.js rewrites `/api/*`, `/fixtures/*`,
`/loras/*`, and `/videos/*` to the backend at `:1318`; the WebSocket
URL comes from `NEXT_PUBLIC_POD_BASE_URL` (set by the launcher).

The full UI lives under `web/` (React + zustand, mirrored from the
internal `daydreamlive/demon-react` package). See `web/components/`,
`web/engine/`, `web/hooks/`, and `web/store/` for the source.

### Backend args

Anything after `--` on the launcher is forwarded to the backend.

`--accel {tensorrt,compile,eager}` sets BOTH `decoder_backend` and
`vae_backend` on the underlying `Session`. Default is `tensorrt`.

`--decoder-accel` and `--vae-accel` override `--accel` for one
component at a time. Useful when, for example, only one of the two
TRT engines exists for a given checkpoint, or when you want to debug
one component in eager while the other stays on TRT:

```bash
# Mix-and-match: TRT decoder, eager VAE.
uv run python -u -m demos.realtime_motion_graph_web.run -- \
    --accel tensorrt --vae-accel eager
```

The text encoder stays resident in VRAM by default so live prompt edits do not
pay CPU/GPU transfer cost. Add `--offload-text-encoder` on lower-VRAM GPUs to
restore the previous lower-memory behavior.

`--checkpoint <name>` selects which DiT checkpoint to load. The name
must match a directory under `<checkpoints_dir>/` (auto-downloaded from
HF on first use). Currently `acestep-v15-turbo` (default, 2B) is the
only vendored variant; other entries in
`acestep.model_downloader.SUBMODEL_REGISTRY` will load once their
modeling files are vendored into `acestep/models/`.

Once it's running:

1. Open `http://localhost:6660/`
2. Click **Play** — the demo loads the default fixture
   (`inside_confusion_loop_60s_gsm.wav`). Fixtures stream from the
   `daydreamlive/demon-fixtures` Hugging Face dataset on first request
   and are cached locally.
3. Switch fixtures any time using the selector at the top of the
   Advanced drawer; switching tears down the session and restarts with
   the new audio.
4. Cold start takes ~15 s while the server loads the model + TRT
   engines (or longer on `--accel compile`); once it's ready the UI
   switches to the live HUD view.

### Audio source vs. video

Audio is the **primary** source: the demo always loads from the
canonical fixture set (`daydreamlive/demon-fixtures` on Hugging Face,
listed in `acestep.fixtures.KNOWN_FIXTURES`), served by the backend
at `/fixtures/<name>` via lazy HF download.
Video is **optional and secondary** — drop any `.mp4`/`.webm`/`.mov`
into `videos/` (sibling of `web/`) to attach the audio-reactive shader
pipeline. With no videos present the demo runs audio-only (graph mode
is the default and looks the same).

## Protocol

The WebSocket protocol is defined in `protocol.py` (the Python source
of truth that `web/engine/protocol.ts` mirrors):

- **Init**: JSON config -> binary audio upload
  (`<uint32 channels><uint32 samples>` + float32 PCM)
- **Server init**: JSON ready + binary float16 initial buffer
- **Streaming**: JSON params/prompt out, binary slice (raw float16 or
  zstd-compressed float16 delta) + `params_update` / `prompt_applied`
  JSON messages in

`server.py` multiplexes the JSON HTTP API, fixture/video file serving,
and the WebSocket upgrade onto one TCP port; the WS handshake hands
off to `backend.handle_client`.

## Audio-reactive video

The video is rendered through a small WebGL2 shader pipeline so it
visually responds to the music in real time. Two effects:

- **Color parallax** — saturated regions drift horizontally with a
  slow sway plus a punch on every kick.
- **Bloom on kick** — luminance-thresholded bloom that brightens with
  the bass envelope.

The same kick amplitude is exposed to CSS as `--bloom-amount`, so the
perimeter HUD bars and the cursor halo glow in lockstep with the
shader bloom on the video.

**Curator setup: nothing.** Color parallax is saturation-driven, not
depth-driven, so there is no preprocessing step and no depth map
sidecars to generate. Drop the source video into `videos/` and run
the launcher as usual. If WebGL2 is unavailable the canvas is hidden
and the plain video plays as fallback.

## Test fixtures

The eight files in `acestep.fixtures.KNOWN_FIXTURES` ship with sidecar
files in the `daydreamlive/demon-fixtures` HF dataset:

```
<name>.sidecar.json         # bpm, key, duration metadata
<name>.sidecar.safetensors  # source latent + context_latent
```

When the client sends `fixture_name` for a known fixture, the server
loads the cached source latent + context latent and reads BPM / key
from the JSON, skipping librosa beat tracking, the CNN key
classifier, and `Session.prepare_source`. `Session.encode_text` still
runs live every connect (it depends on the prompt and the demo's
blended-prompt UI typically diverges from any baked tags within
seconds of connecting; the ~60ms warm cost isn't worth the cache
complication). For ad-hoc uploads (no `fixture_name`), the full live
path runs as before.

The runtime checks `out/fixture_sidecars/` first (so local edits are
tested without an upload round-trip) and falls through to the
dataset.

If you want to override the BPM or key for a fixture, edit the
`<name>.sidecar.json` and re-run the precompute script. Editing the
JSON's `bpm` / `key` fields and re-running preserves them (the
script only re-derives values that aren't already pinned). To
forcibly re-derive everything from scratch, pass `--force`:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.precompute_fixture_sidecars
uv run python -m scripts.precompute_fixture_sidecars --force
uv run python -m scripts.precompute_fixture_sidecars --only \
    inside_confusion_loop_60s_gsm.wav
```

After editing, upload the regenerated `<name>.sidecar.json` and
`<name>.sidecar.safetensors` pair back to the HF dataset.

## Browser notes

- **Web Audio**: an `AudioWorkletNode` drives a shared PCM buffer that
  the main thread patches in place on each slice. Same crossfade logic
  as the native `AudioEngine` (50 ms on swap, in-place delta add
  otherwise).
- **Web MIDI**: auto-attaches the first input. Values use the
  endless-encoder two's-complement CC semantics from the native client
  so existing controllers just work.
- **Webcam**: `getUserMedia` with a low-res capture canvas and a simple
  abs-diff detector, smoothed like the OpenCV version.

## Troubleshooting

- **"WebSocket connection failed"**: verify the backend is reachable on
  `:1318` (firewall, reverse proxy). The launcher logs `[backend]`
  output if the Python side crashed.
- **Audio plays silent on first connect**: browsers gate audio on a
  user gesture; `Connect & start` counts as one, so this should "just
  work" but if it doesn't, click anywhere in the HUD view.
- **No MIDI devices listed**: Web MIDI requires `localhost` or HTTPS in
  Chromium. Use the local `http://localhost:6660` URL, or run behind a
  reverse proxy with TLS for remote access.
- **Webcam permission denied**: same-origin constraint as MIDI. Switch
  to on-screen knobs mode if the browser blocks the camera.
- **Cold start long**: the GPU server rebuilds the pipeline on every
  new connection, same as the native server. Reuse connections when
  possible.
