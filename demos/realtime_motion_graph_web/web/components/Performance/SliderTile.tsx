  denoise:
    "How much the model reshapes the source audio. Keep it low for a subtle remix that stays close to the original; push it high to fully transform the track into something new. The most expressive knob — try sweeping it during playback.",
  hint_strength:
    "How closely the model follows the original song's structure — sections, rhythm, dynamics. Crank it up to keep the arrangement intact; drop it to let the model rearrange more freely.",
  timbre_strength:
    "How much of the source's instrument character (tone, color) carries into the output. High keeps the original instruments recognizable; low frees the model to swap them for whatever fits the prompt.",

  // ── Engine internals ──
  feedback:
    "How similar each new generation is to the previous one. Low values give you variety on every refresh; higher values give you a continuous evolution where each generation flows into the next. 0.3–0.5 is the sweet spot for smooth continuity without everything sounding the same.",
  shift:
    "Advanced: changes where the model concentrates its work across denoising. The default is tuned for the turbo engine and works well in most cases — leave it alone unless you're chasing a specific feel.",
  ode_noise:
    "Adds a touch of randomness during generation. Bump it up if the model feels too deterministic — small values add subtle variation, higher values produce surprising bursts of creativity. Zero keeps generation fully predictable.",
  guidance_scale:
    "CFG strength. Only takes effect when the RCFG mode dropdown below is NOT 'off'. Higher values push the output further toward the prompt at the cost of more artifacts. Turbo is CFG-distilled, so the useful range is narrower than a base SD model — try 3–8.",
  cfg_rescale:
    "After CFG, mix the guided velocity's magnitude back toward what the positive forward produced. 0 keeps raw CFG; 1 fully snaps the magnitude. Pair with high guidance_scale to keep the prompt-push without the harshness that high CFG causes on its own.",
