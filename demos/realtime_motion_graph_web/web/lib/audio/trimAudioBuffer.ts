 *  original buffer is not retained. Used by WaveformTrimDialog after
 *  the user confirms the trim window.
 *
 *  Pool alignment matches the rule in loadFixture.decodeArrayBuffer:
 *  start floor-aligns to the previous pool boundary, end floor-aligns
 *  to a pool boundary at-or-before endS. The resulting length is at
 *  least one pool (0.2 s at 48 kHz) — caller is responsible for not
 *  passing a window narrower than that. */
