"""Typed events + bounded fan-out event bus for the streaming session.

The :class:`~acestep.streaming.session.StreamingSession` publishes typed
events; transport adapters subscribe via an :class:`EventBus` that fans
them out through bounded per-subscriber queues.

Field shapes follow ``notes/api_layer_protocol_matrix.md`` Section 3:
the dataclass is the wire's superset (the adapter may serialize only a
subset to JSON). Numpy arrays carried inside events are produced once
on the runner thread; subscribers must not mutate them in place.

Backpressure model:

- Each :class:`Subscription` owns a bounded buffer (default 256) and a
  daemon drainer thread that invokes the listener callback.
- :meth:`EventBus.publish` is non-blocking. The runner thread never
  waits on a subscriber. A slow remote subscriber cannot stall GPU
  ticks; it sees drops, coalesces, or close-on-overflow per its
  configured :class:`BackpressurePolicy`.
- :class:`AudioReady` events drop oldest-first when full. Best-effort
  recovery: under the current runner's sliding-window decode (stride
  well below ``vae_window``) a dropped buffer region is typically
  re-covered by the next overlapping slice. Persistent saturation
  compounds drops, so stale regions can survive until a later
  overlapping slice lands or the WS reconnects. A runner with stride
  near or above the window would need close-on-overflow for audio
  instead. :class:`ParamsUpdate` and :class:`ParamsEcho` coalesce
  (only the latest value matters). Control-plane events
  (``SwapReady``, ``LoraCatalogUpdate``, ``SessionReady``, etc.)
  never drop; an overfull subscription is closed instead, after a
  single :class:`SubscriberDropped` is delivered to the listener.

Today the only subscriber is the demo's WS adapter and the buffer
rarely fills, so this is structural-readiness for the future
remote-transport case.
