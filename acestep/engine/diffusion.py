    Attributes:
        infer_steps: Number of diffusion steps.
        infer_method: Solver type, "ode" (Euler) or "sde" (stochastic).
        shift: Timestep shift for flow matching. ACEStep turbo uses 3.0.
        seed: Random seed for noise generation.
        use_cache: Enable KV caching for cross-attention. Disabled by
            default to match ComfyUI behavior (no KV caching). Enable for
            faster inference when exact ComfyUI parity is not required.
        noise_on_cpu: Generate noise on CPU in [B,D,T] layout then
            transpose to [B,T,D], matching ComfyUI's RandomNoise node.
            When False, uses the HF model's prepare_noise (GPU, [B,T,D]).
        timesteps: Explicit timestep schedule (overrides infer_steps/shift).
        denoise: Denoising strength in [0, 1]. Controls how much of the
            source audio to preserve vs regenerate:
              1.0 = generate from pure noise (full generation)
              0.5 = start halfway through the noise schedule (style transfer)
              0.0 = no denoising (passthrough)
            When < 1.0, source_latents must be provided to generate().
            The schedule is computed as int(steps/denoise) full steps, then
