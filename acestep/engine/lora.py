"""Backend-agnostic LoRA manager.

Owns the catalog, lifecycle (REGISTERED -> MATERIALIZING -> MATERIALIZED
-> ENABLED), background prewarm, and delta math (B @ A) for dynamic LoRA
application. Subclasses plug in *where the live weights live*: a TRT
engine via IRefitter, or a PyTorch decoder's parameters directly.

Library:
  ``register_library(directory)`` discovers ``*.safetensors`` in a flat
  directory and registers each as a REGISTERED entry whose id is the
  filename stem. The catalog backs an "infinite library" workflow where
  hundreds of LoRAs cost nothing until enabled.

Threading:
  - register / enable / disable / set_strength / refit run on the
    inference-owning thread; refit and inference are mutually exclusive.
  - prewarm runs on a background ThreadPoolExecutor; the worker only
    fills the entry's deltas dict and never touches the engine.

      A library workflow that prewarms dozens of LoRAs costs system
      RAM, not VRAM.
    - On the ENABLED transition, the entry's deltas are mirrored into a
      per-id **GPU** buffer (``self._gpu_deltas[id]``). Refits read from

      enables a LoRA pays no extra VRAM.
